# Shopping and Birthday Program

This repository contains two Python scripts: `Lab1.py` and `Lab2.py`, each performing different functions related to shopping and calculating upcoming birthdays.

## Lab1.py

### Description
`Lab1.py` is a program that simulates a shopping system. It prompts the user to input item costs, tax rates, and shipping costs, then calculates the total cost including tax and shipping.

### Usage
Run the script `Lab1.py`. It will prompt you to input the item costs, tax rate, and shipping costs. The program will then display the subtotal, tax amount, shipping costs, and the total amount to be paid.

### Modifications
- Added a variable `n` in the `getItemCosts()` function.
- Adjusted formatting and fixed syntax errors in various parts of the code.
- Corrected the calculation for the total amount to be paid.

## Lab2.py

### Description
`Lab2.py` prompts the user to input their name, age, and birthday. It then calculates whether the birthday has passed or is upcoming.

### Usage
Run the script `Lab2.py`. Input your name, age, and birthday (in MM/DD/YYYY format). The program will determine whether your birthday has passed or is upcoming.

### Modifications
- Used `datetime` functions to calculate the upcoming or past birthday.
- Implemented error handling for age and date inputs.
- Enhanced the output messages for different scenarios.

## File Structure
- `Lab1.py`: Shopping program.
