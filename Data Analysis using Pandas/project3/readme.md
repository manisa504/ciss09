# Pandas and NumPy Data Manipulation README

## Overview

This repository contains Python code utilizing the Pandas and NumPy libraries for data manipulation and analysis. The code involves creating, modifying, and filtering DataFrames to extract specific information.

## File Structure

- **`data_manipulation.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing code for Pandas and NumPy operations.
- **`README.md`**: Detailed documentation summarizing the code steps, methodologies, and outcomes.

## Description

### Data Creation and DataFrame Operations

- Created a DataFrame `df1` using Pandas, containing information such as name, score, attempt, and pass/fail.
- Selected and displayed specific rows and columns from `df1`.
- Filtered rows based on conditions like attempts greater than 2 and missing scores ('N/A').
- Combined conditions to filter rows meeting specific criteria.
- Appended a new record to `df1` and displayed the updated DataFrame.
- Removed a specific record ('h') from the DataFrame.
- Replaced 'Yes' and 'No' values in the 'pass/fail' column with 'pass' and 'fail', respectively.

## Results

The provided code demonstrates data manipulation operations using Pandas and NumPy, involving data creation, selection, filtering, appending, and value replacement in DataFrames. Each step ensures effective data handling and modification based on specific conditions and requirements.
