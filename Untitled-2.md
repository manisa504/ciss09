The code is a Python script that calculates the assessed value and property tax of a given property. The script contains two functions: main() and displayOutput().

The main() function takes in the value of a property as an input and performs the following operations:

Defines a variable tax and assigns it a value of 0.72, which represents the tax rate of the property.
Calculates the assessed value of the property by multiplying the input value by 0.6.
Calculates the total property tax by dividing the assessed value by 100 and then multiplying it by the tax rate.
Calls the displayOutput() function and passes the calculated assessed value and property tax as arguments.
The displayOutput() function takes in two arguments, the assessed value and property tax of the property. It performs the following operation:

Uses the print() function to display the assessed value and property tax in a formatted manner, rounded up to two decimal places.
The script also contains an if __name__ == '__main__': block that is executed only when the script is run directly. In this block, the script prompts the user to enter the actual value of the property and assigns the input to the variable taxPay. The main() function is then called with taxPay as the input.

Overall, the script takes in the actual value of a property, calculates the assessed value and property tax, and displays the results in a formatted manner.
