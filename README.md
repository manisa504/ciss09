# About me
About Me
I am a dedicated PowerBI Developer at Intel, actively engaged in leveraging my expertise in data visualization and analysis to drive informed decision-making within the company. Concurrently, I am pursuing a graduate degree in Data Science and Business Analytics at Texas Tech University.

My journey began in dentistry, where I cultivated a deep understanding of patient care during my tenure as a dental assistant in the USA. Witnessing the transformative impact of cutting-edge technologies like 3D scanning and printing in healthcare ignited my interest in the intersection of technology and industry evolution. This realization motivated my transition into the dynamic field of data science.

My enthusiasm for data science is reflected in the completion of diverse projects, notably including a sentiment analysis project on the Google App Store. This project aimed to uncover biases surrounding paid and free apps, showcasing my analytical capabilities.

Professionally, I bring a robust skill set in healthcare technology alongside proficiency in leveraging Azure Cloud services. My technical prowess spans programming languages like Python, database management using MySQL, and a toolkit featuring PowerBI, Tableau, Numpy, and Pandas for data extraction, analysis, and visualization.

Combining my healthcare background with evolving expertise in data science, I am driven to harness data-driven insights to catalyze innovation within the technology industry.
