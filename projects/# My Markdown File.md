This function calculates the mileage of a vehicle based on the speed and time traveled.


## Subheading


 1.It first initializes a mileage variable to 0.0 and an empty dictionary called mileageDictionary. 
 2.It then prints a header for the output table. 
 3.Next, it iterates through a range of hours from 0 to the input number of hours + 1.
 4.For each hour, it calculates the mileage traveled by multiplying the speed by the number of hours traveled, and adds the result to the mileageDictionary with the hour as the key. 
 5.Finally, it iterates through the mileageDictionary and prints the hour and corresponding mileage for each key-value pair in the dictionary.
