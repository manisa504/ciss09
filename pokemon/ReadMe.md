 <!--  This code is written in Python and uses two popular libraries for data analysis, Pandas and Matplotlib.

The first three lines of the code import the necessary libraries, including Pandas and Matplotlib, which are used for data manipulation and visualization respectively.

The next line of code reads a CSV file from a local server and stores it in a Pandas DataFrame object called "df". The file path is specified in the code using the "/Users/abhishekshah/Desktop/Pokemon/pokemon_data.csv" file path.

The code then prints the first five rows of the DataFrame using the "head()" method of Pandas. This method is used to retrieve the first few rows of the DataFrame, which can be useful for quickly understanding the structure and content of the data.

The next line of code prints the column names of the DataFrame using the "columns" attribute of Pandas. This provides an easy way to view the column names of the DataFrame.

The following line of code prints the "Name", "Type 1", and "HP" columns of the DataFrame using the double hard brackets to access multiple columns at once.

The next line of code prints the first four rows of the DataFrame using the "head()" method again, but this time without a specified parameter, which defaults to five.

The next line of code retrieves rows 1 to 3 of the DataFrame using the "iloc[]" method of Pandas. This method is used to access rows and columns of the DataFrame by their index.

The following line of code retrieves the value in the second row and second column of the DataFrame using the "iloc[]" method.

The next few lines of code use a loop to iterate over each row in the DataFrame, printing the index and "Name" column of each row.

The next line of code retrieves all rows where the "Type 1" column equals "Grass" using the "loc[]" method of Pandas. This method is used to access rows and columns of the DataFrame by label.

The next line of code provides a summary of the DataFrame using the "describe()" method of Pandas. This method generates descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset.

The following two lines of code sort the DataFrame by the "Name" and "Type 1" columns, respectively. The "sort_values()" method of Pandas is used for this purpose, which sorts the DataFrame in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.

The next few lines of code add a new column to the DataFrame called "Total" that contains the sum of the "HP", "Attack", "Defense", "Sp. Atk", "Sp. Def", and "Speed" columns. This is done using basic arithmetic operations and Pandas' ability to broadcast operations across entire columns.

The final lines of code save the modified DataFrame to an Excel file called "modified.xlsxl" and print the first five rows of the DataFrame. -->
