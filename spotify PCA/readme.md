# Spotify PCA Analysis

This repository contains code for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a Spotify dataset to explore underlying patterns and relationships between different musical features. The analysis involves using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Overview

The provided code performs PCA on a Spotify dataset, aiming to uncover essential patterns in the musical features of songs available on the platform. The primary steps involved in this analysis are:

1. **Loading and Data Preprocessing**: Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and selecting relevant numerical features for PCA.

2. **Standardization and PCA**: Standardizing the selected features and applying PCA to identify the principal components that explain the variance in the dataset.

3. **Scree Plot and Cumulative Explained Variance**: Visualization of the scree plot and cumulative explained variance plot to determine the optimal number of principal components to retain.

4. **Interpreting Principal Components**: Investigating the composition of the initial few principal components to understand their influence on the dataset.

5. **Loadings Analysis**: Analyzing the loadings of principal components to identify influential features and their contributions to the components.

## Code Structure

- `spotify_pca_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code for performing PCA on the Spotify dataset.
- `spotify.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset**: Ensure that the `spotify.csv` dataset is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Libraries**: Make sure to have Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn installed.
3. **Execution**: Execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially to perform the PCA analysis step by step.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the composition of principal components and their relationships with musical features, offering a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure.

## Conclusion

The PCA analysis aims to uncover underlying patterns and relationships within the Spotify dataset, which can aid in feature engineering, genre classification, or recommendation systems related to music.
