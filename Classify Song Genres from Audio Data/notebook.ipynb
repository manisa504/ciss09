Train a decision tree to classify genre\n","<p>Now we can use the lower dimensional PCA projection of the data to classify songs into genres. </p>\n","<p>Here, we will be using a simple algorithm known as a decision tree. Decision trees are rule-based classifiers that take in features and follow a 'tree structure' of binary decisions to ultimately classify a data point into one of two or more categories. In addition to being easy to both use and interpret, decision trees allow us to visualize the 'logic flowchart' that the model generates from the training data.</p>\n","<p>Here is an example of a decision tree that demonstrates the process by which an input image (in this case, of a shape) might be classified based on the number of sides it has and whether it is rotated.</p>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_449/img/simple_decision_tree.png\" alt=\"Decision Tree Flow Chart Example\" width=\"350px\"></p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":356,"id":"e20c1555-500e-4a85-8558-f16265f8afb1","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"dc":{"key":"52"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import Decision tree classifier\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n","\n","# Create our decision tree\n","tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=10)\n","\n","# Train our decision tree\n","tree.fit(train_pca, train_labels)\n","\n","# Predict the labels for the test data\n","pred_labels_tree = tree.predict(test_pca)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"810d6bd2-91ac-42d1-a591-1c0c72f8c3b1","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"59"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"source":["## 9. Compare our decision tree to a logistic regression\n","<p>Although our tree's performance is decent, it's a bad idea to immediately assume that it's therefore the perfect tool for this job -- there's always the possibility of other models that will perform even better! It's always a worthwhile idea to at least test a few other algorithms and find the one that's best for our data.</p>\n","<p>Sometimes simplest is best, and so we will start by applying <strong>logistic regression</strong>. Logistic regression makes use of what's called the logistic function to calculate the odds that a given data point belongs to a given class.

Balance our data for greater performance\n","<p>Both our models do similarly well, boasting an average precision of 87% each. However, looking at our classification report, we can see that rock songs are fairly well classified, but hip-hop songs are disproportionately misclassified as rock songs. </p>\n","<p>Why might this be the case? Well, just by looking at the number of data points we have for each class, we see that we have far more data points for the rock classification than for hip-hop, potentially skewing our model's ability to distinguish between classes. This also tells us that most of our model's accuracy is driven by its ability to classify just rock songs, which is less than ideal.</p>\n","<p>To account for this, we can weight the value of a correct classification in each class inversely to the occurrence of data points for each class.

Although there are many different CV methods, all with their own advantages and disadvantages, we will use what's known as <strong>K-fold</strong> CV here. K-fold first splits the data into K different, equally sized subsets. Then, it iteratively uses each subset as a test set while using the remainder of the data as train sets. Finally, we can then aggregate the results from each fold for a final model performance score.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":364,"id":"b511c091-e487-41d7-98d7-badd8a0fcc4c","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"80"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Decision Tree: 0.7219780219780221 Logistic Regression: 0.773076923076923\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","tree_pipe = Pipeline([(\"scaler\", StandardScaler()), (\"pca\", PCA(n_components=6)), \n","                      (\"tree\", DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=10))])\n","logreg_pipe = Pipeline([(\"scaler\", StandardScaler()), (\"pca\", PCA(n_components=6)), \n","                        (\"logreg\", LogisticRegression(random_state=10))])\n","\n","# Set up our K-fold cross-validation\n","kf = KFold(10)\n","\n","# Train our models using KFold cv\n","tree_score = cross_val_score(tree_pipe, features, labels, cv=kf)\n","logit_score = cross_val_score(logreg_pipe, features, labels, cv=kf)\n","\n","# Print the mean of each array o scores\n","print(\"Decision Tree:\", np.mean(tree_score), \"Logistic Regression:\", np.mean(logit_score))"]}],"metadata":{"editor":"DataCamp Workspace","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.10.7 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.7"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"aee8b7b246df8f9039afb4144a1f6fd8d2ca17a180786b69acc140d282b71a49"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
